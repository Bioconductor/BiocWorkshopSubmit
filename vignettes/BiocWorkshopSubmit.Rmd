# BiocWorkshopSubmit

## Introduction & Installation

The `BiocWorkshopSubmit` package is a Shiny app that allows users to submit
Bioconductor workshops to the
[Bioconductor Workshop](https://workshop.bioconductor.org) website via the
[workshop contributions repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Bioconductor/workshop-contributions).
The app is designed to be used as a standalone local app with a particular
setup.

The package is only available on GitHub and can be installed with the following
command:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("Bioconductor/BiocWorkshopSubmit")
```    

## Setup

Workshop submitters should include the following files in their workshop:

A `DESCRIPTION` file with the following fields:

- Title: A title for the workshop
- Description: A short description of the workshop
- URL: A URL to the workshop repository from either GHCR or Docker Hub

Note. The container should be built using the `Dockerfile` that is included in
the example
[BuildABiocWorkshop](https://github.com/bioconductor/buildabiocworkshop)
repository. It can either point to `docker.io` or `ghcr.io`.
    
The `DESCRIPTION` file should be used to indicate what packages are needed for
the workshop. The `DESCRIPTION` file should also be used to indicate what
version of R is needed for the workshop.

Once the container is built, the workshop should be tested locally to ensure
that it works as expected. The workshop should be tested (preferably) on the
latest release version of R and Bioconductor.

### Creating a GH Issue

The app will create a GitHub issue in the the `workshop-contributions`
repository. Submitters should generate a fine-grained personal access token
via GitHub <https://github.com/settings/tokens>. The token should have the
`public_repo` scope. The token should be saved with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.
Once the token is saved, the app will use it to create the issue.

## Usage

The app can be launched with the following command:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
BiocWorkshopSubmit::BiocWorkshopSubmit()
```

![BiocWorkshopSubmit Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bioconductor/BiocWorkshopSubmit/devel/vignettes/BiocWorkshopSubmit_interface.png)

The app will prompt the presenter to submit the following information:

- GitHub repository: The GitHub repository where the workshop contents are
hosted.
- Workshop ID: A unique identifier for the workshop, e.g., `tidybioc2023`.
- Section: The section that corresponds to the group of workshops for a
particular event (if any; e.g., `Bioc2023`).
- Start File: The file that should be open when the user logs in to the workshop
instance.
- Container Tag: The tag for the container that should be used for the workshop
(typically, `latest`).

The workshop presenter will be able to auto-populate the fields in the app
by clicking the `Populate` button. The app will use the `DESCRIPTION` file
on GitHub to update the fields in the app.

### Additional Information

![Additional Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bioconductor/BiocWorkshopSubmit/devel/vignettes/AdditionalInformation.png)

Workshop presenters can also provide additional information regarding the size,
start time, and date of the workshop. This information will be used to allocate
resources for the workshop on the Bioconductor Workshop website.

- Workshop Date: The date interval of the workshop event.
- Workshop Start Time (24h format): The start time of the workshop event in
Eastern US time.
- Expected Number of Participants: The expected number of participants for the
workshop.

### Submitting the Workshop

After the details of the workshop have been entered, the workshop presenter
will be able to click the red `Submit` button to submit the workshop to the
`workshop-contributions` repository. The app will create a GitHub issue in the
`workshop-contributions` repository with the details of the workshop.
Please monitor the issue for any comments from the Bioconductor team.

Thank you for your contribution to the Bioconductor Workshop website!

## Example Workshops

The following workshops have been submitted to the Bioconductor Workshop:

- MultiAssayWorkshop: <https://github.com/waldronlab/MultiAssayWorkshop>
- ISMB.OSCA: <https://github.com/Bioconductor/ISMB.OSCA>

Feel free to refer to these workshops as examples of how to structure the
workshop package for submission to the Bioconductor Workshop website.
